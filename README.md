# PHP-Live_Chat_System

This is an instant web chat system based on PHP that was once part of the Carmen hospital management system. 

It enables doctors to communicate with patients' families in real-time. 

The system consists of three parts: the doctor's side, the patient's family side, and the database file.

The doctor's side is composed of five parts:

1.Patient inquiry section: In this section, doctors can search for the patient list they manage and select the patient's family they want to chat with.
2.Chat page section: This is the main page for chatting, responsible for collecting information about the chat content and the sender.
3.Main function section: This is where various functions for chat communication are completed, including storing and retrieving chat content from the database.
4.Chat message insertion section: This section is responsible for transferring information such as chat content, sender, and recipient, and passing it to the main function for storage in the database.
5.Chat message retrieval section: This section is responsible for transferring chat content, sender, recipient, and other information read by the main function to the chat page section.


The patient's family side is composed of four parts:

1.Chat page section: This is the main page for chatting, responsible for collecting information about the chat content and the sender.
2.Main function section: This is where various functions for chat communication are completed, including storing and retrieving chat content from the database.
3.Chat message insertion section: This section is responsible for transferring information such as chat content, sender, and recipient, and passing it to the main function for storage in the database.
4.Chat message retrieval section: This section is responsible for transferring chat content, sender, recipient, and other information read by the main function to the chat page section.

Completely open and free to use. (You can even use it without mentioning my name.)
